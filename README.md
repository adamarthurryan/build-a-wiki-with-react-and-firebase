## Instructor: [Andrew Burgess][instructor url]


React is a powerful and performant JavaScript library. In this course, Tuts+ instructor Andrew Burgess will show you how to use it to build a multi-user web application from start to finish. 

You'll also learn how to use Firebase, a cloud-hosted data backend for web and mobile applications. In this course, you'll use Firebase to implement a very simple JSON-based data store for the course project:  a live collaborative wiki. 

## Source Files Description

This repository contains modified source code from the course project - a multi-user collaborative wiki implemented with React and Firebase.

The wiki has been refactored to eliminate the necessity of a Node.js server. All user auth is now handled by Firebase.
